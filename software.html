<a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq>pdaggerq</a> is a fermionic
computer algebra package for generating equations and code for many-body 
quantum chemistry methods, such as coupled cluster theory.

<a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/libsdp>libSDP</a> is a library
of semidefinite programming solvers with C/C++ and Python interfaces.

<a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/hilbert>hilbert</a> is a plugin to
the Psi4 electronic strucuture package that implements various electronic
structure methods, including the variational two-electron reduced density
matrix (v2RDM) and quantum electrodynamics generalizations of
Hartree-Fock, (time-dependent) density functional theory,
(equation-of-motion) coupled cluster theory, and more.

<a href=https://urania.chem.washington.edu/chronusq/chronusq_public/-/wikis/home>Chronus Quantum</a> 
is an <i>ab initio</i> computational chemistry software package 
that focuses on explicitly time-dependent and unconventional post-SCF 
quantum mechanical methods. <br>

<br>

Through this SciDAC partnership, we are developing time-dependent and relativistic 
formulations of the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster and 
multireference configuration interaction methods in Chronus Quantum,
and we are designing our codes such that they can be deployed in massively-parallel computing environments.
To this end, our codes rely on the scalable tensor framework <a href=https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray>TiledArray</a>. <br>
