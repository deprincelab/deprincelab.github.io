<a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq>pdaggerq</a> is a fermionic
computer algebra package for generating equations and code for many-body 
quantum chemistry methods, such as coupled cluster theory.

<a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/hilbert>hilbert</a> is a plugin to
the Psi4 electronic strucuture package that implements various electronic
structure methods, including the variational two-electron reduced density
matrix (v2RDM) and quantum electrodynamics generalizations of
Hartree-Fock, (time-dependent) density functional theory,
(equation-of-motion) coupled cluster theory, and more.

<a href=https://urania.chem.washington.edu/chronusq/chronusq_public/-/wikis/home>Chronus Quantum</a> 
is an <i>ab initio</i> computational chemistry software package 
that focuses on explicitly time-dependent and relativistic 
quantum mechanical methods. The DePrince group develops massively parallel 
relativistic coupled-cluster methods in Chronus Quantum. <br>

<img src="../images/QCLogo.png" alt="Q-Chem" style="width: 30%">

<a href=https://www.q-chem.com>Q-Chem</a> is an <i>ab initio</i> quantum
chemistry software package for fast and accurate simulations of molecular
systems, including electronic and molecular structure, reactivities,
properties, and structure. The DePrince group has implemented the
variational two-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM) method in Q-Chem. <br>
