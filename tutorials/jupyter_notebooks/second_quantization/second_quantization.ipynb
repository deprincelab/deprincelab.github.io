    "Second quantization is a convenient formalism in quantum chemistry that allows one to represent quantum mechanical operators and wave functions in terms of operators that create or destroy particles (creation and annihilation operators, respectively). This project provides an overview of the properties of Fermionic creation and annihilation operators and introduces the second-quantized forms of one- and two-particle operators and many-particle wave functions. It also covers the concept of normal order, which is useful for evaluating integrals involving second-quantized operators and wave functions. Python code is provided for bringing strings of second-quantized operators to normal order, using the [$p^\\dagger q$ package](https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq)."
