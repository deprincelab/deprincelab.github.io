    "The last few notebooks have considered analytically solvable model problems involving translational, vibrational, and rotational motion of quantum particles. Here, we consider a hydrogenic atom (a nucleus plus a single electron), which is the most complex problem for which we can find a closed-form analytic solution. This notebook outlines the solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a hydrogenic atom and provides Python code to visualize and interpret the resulting wave functions."
