    "In the previous notebooks, we discussed quantum mechanical problems involving translational and vibrational motion. In this notebook, we explore the properties of the operators corresponding to the angular momentum of a microscopic particle and model problems for rotational motion. We will find analytic solutions the Schrödinger equation for the particle-on-a-ring and particle-on-a-sphere models, which are models for rotational in two or three dimensions, respectively. The particle-on-a-sphere model is also known as the rigid rotor."
