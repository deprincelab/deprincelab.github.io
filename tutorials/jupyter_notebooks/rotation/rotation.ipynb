    "In the previous notebooks, we discussed quantum mechanical problems involving translational and vibrational motion. In this notebook, we explore the properties of the operators corresponding to the angular momentum of a microscopic particle and model problems for rotational motion. We will find analytic solutions the Schrödinger equation for the particle-on-a-ring and particle-on-a-sphere models, which are models for rotational in two or three dimensions, respectively. The particle-on-a-sphere model is also known as the rigid rotor."

    "From this figure, we can make the following observations:\n",
    "1. The ground state ($l=0$) is a state for which the particle has zero angular momentum.\n",
    "2. For all states with $l>0,$, there are $2l+1$ different states with different $m$ values. The magnitude of the angular momentum is the same for each of these states (as is the energy), but the direction in which the angular momentum vector points is different.\n",
    "3. The $z$ projection of the angular momentum is quantized. This space quantization is at odds with the classical picture of angular momentum in a classical rotating body. However, we can see that the number of possible $z$ projections increases with $l$. In the limit that $l$ becomes large, the $z$ projection of the angular momentum becomes effectively continuous. This result is another manifestation of the **Bohr Correspondence Principle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector diagram is informative, but it is misleading in the sense that it makes it appear as though, in addition to knowledge regarding the magnitude and $z$ projection of the angular momentum vector, we also know something about its $x$ or $y$ component, depending on what the $x$ axis in the figure above is meant to represent. In reality, we can know **nothing** about the $x$ and $y$ components of the angular momentum vector because we know exactly what the $z$ component is and the relevant operators do not commute (although, the $l=0$ state is a special case which we will consider below). In reality, the angular momentum vector should lie on the edge of a **cone** with known magnitude and $z$ projection, as the following Python code illustrates for the $l=1$ states."

Conversely, if these operators do not commute, then no such set of eigenfunctions exist, and it will not be possible, in general, to specify both $A$ and $B$ exactly, simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a particle constrained to move on a sphere in a state described by $Y^m_l(\\theta, \\phi),$ the product of the uncertainties in the $x$ and $y$ projections of the angular momentum would be\n",
    "\n",

    "\\Delta L_x \\Delta L_y &\\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\left | \\langle Y^m_l(\\theta, \\phi) | [\\hat{L}_x, \\hat{L}_y] | Y^m_l(\\theta, \\phi) \\rangle \\right | \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Because $\\hat{L}_x$ and $\\hat{L}_y$ do not commute, it is impossible to find a complete set of common eigenfunctions for both operators. Is it ever possible to specify the $x$ and $y$ components of the angular momentum, simultaneously, with arbitrary precision? Surprisingly, the answer to this question is yes, but only in a single special case. Consider the state with $l=0$ and $m=0$. This is a state with zero total angular momentum and, obviously, zero $z$ projection of angular momentum. Because the total angular momentum is zero, the $x$ and $y$ projections must be exactly equal to zero, too! This result implies that the function $Y^0_0(\\theta, \\phi)$ is an eigenfunction of all four operators, $\\hat{L}^2$, $\\hat{L}_x$, $\\hat{L}_y$, and $\\hat{L}_z.$ The existence of a single common eigenfunction of these operators does not contradict the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, though. It is still impossible to specify a **complete** set of common eigenfunctions for these operators."
