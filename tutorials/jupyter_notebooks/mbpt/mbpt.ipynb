    "# Many-Body Perturbation Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) is a non-variational approach based on non-degenerate perturbation theory that can be used to find approximate solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation. This project provides an overview of the theoretical aspects of MBPT and a derivation of energy and wave function expressions for the first few orders, aided by the [p$^\\dagger$q package](https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq) for manipulating strings of second-quantized operators. For a review of key concepts in non-degenerate perturbation theory, refer to [these notes](https://deprincelab.github.io/tutorials/jupyter_notebooks/perturbation/perturbation.html).

    "To evaluate the second-order energy numerically, we can use the Psi4 package (or any other package that gives us access to the required integrals). The following code runs a Hartree-Fock calculation on H$_2$O$^+$ and extracts the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-spin MO coefficient matrices and energies. Note that some of the keyword options are chosen to tighten convergence and to avoid the use of the density fitting approximation.
