    "# Many-Body Perturbation Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) is a non-variational approach based on non-degenerate perturbation theory that can be used to find approximate solutions to the electronic Schrödinger equation. This project provides an overview of the theoretical aspects of MBPT and a derivation of energy and wave function expressions for the first few orders, aided by the [$p^\\dagger q$ package](https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq) for manipulating strings of second-quantized operators. For a review of key concepts in non-degenerate perturbation theory, refer to [these notes](https://deprincelab.github.io/tutorials/jupyter_notebooks/perturbation/perturbation.html).

    "To evaluate the second-order energy numerically, we can use the Psi4 package (or any other package that gives us access to the required integrals). The following code runs a Hartree-Fock calculation on H$_2$O$^+$ and extracts the $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-spin MO coefficient matrices and energies. Note that some of the keyword options are chosen to tighten convergence and to avoid the use of the density fitting approximation. Eventually, we will compare our second-order energy to the same quantity evaluated using Psi4, and we want to avoid any sources of possible disagreement. "
