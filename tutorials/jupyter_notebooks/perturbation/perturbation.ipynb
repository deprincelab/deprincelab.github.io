    "#### Interpretation of these Results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perturbed energies and wave functions allow us to \"mix\" character of other zeroth-order states into state $n$. This mixing is necessary because $|psi_n^{(0)}\\rangle$ will not look exactly like $|\\psi_n\\rangle$.\n",
    "2. The $\\frac{1}{E_n^{(0)} - E_k^{(0)}}$ term implies that states nearby in energy dominate perturbative corrections for state $n$.\n",
    "3. In general, summations can be infinite (e.g., as we saw for the anharmonic oscillator problem). Exceptions include Møller-Plesset perturbation theory.\n",
    "4. Higher-order corrections to the energies and wave functions can become extremely complicated. In electronic structure theory, the highest-order corrections one would typically encouter would be fourth-order [MP4 or CCSD(T)] or fifth order [CCSD(T)].\n",
    "5. If the zeroth-order problem has a continuum of eigenfunctions (e.g., unbound states in the hydrogen atom problem), the these states must be included in the perturbative expansins (in these cases, sums over states become integrals).\n",
    "6. The approach outlined above works well for non-degenerate $\\hat{H}_0$ and when the perturbation is \"small.\" In such cases, $|\\psi_n^{(0)}\\rangle$ gives a good approximation to $|\\psi_n\\rangle$.  "
