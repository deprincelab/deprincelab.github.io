Microscopic particles such as electrons and protons behave differently
than the macroscopic objects we deal with in every day life. In
particular, their motion cannot be described by classical physics (e.g.,
Newton's equations of motion), and we must rely on a completely different
framework in order to understand their properties. That framework is
quantum mechanics. With the proper application of quantum-mechanical
principles, we can understand and even predict chemical and physical
phenomena that cannot be described by classical theories. As chemists,
quantum mechanics can be used, among other things, to help us characterize
molecular species (using spectroscopic tools like IR, UV-VIS, circular
dichroism, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure [NEXAFS], etc.) or
predict chemical properties (using molecular orbital theory or more
sophisticated approaches).

This tutorial outlines the postulates of quantum mechanics, which are the
fundamental principles that govern how quantum mechanical objects behave
and how one can describe these objects mathematically. It also provides
Python code to illustrate some important concepts numerically.
