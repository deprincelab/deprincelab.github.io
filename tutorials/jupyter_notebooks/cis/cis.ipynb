    "# Configuration Interaction with Single Excitations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding tutorials, we have explored strategies for finding approximations to the lowest-energy eigenfunctions of the electronic Hamiltonian (using [Hartree-Fock theory](https://deprincelab.github.io/tutorials/jupyter_notebooks/hartree_fock/hartree_fock.html) and [many-body perturbation theory](https://deprincelab.github.io/tutorials/jupyter_notebooks/mbpt/mbpt.html)). In this project, we explore the simplest possible wave function *ansatz* for modeling electronically excited states, which is known as configuration interaction with single excitations (CIS). We will develop a CIS code using the Python interface to the Psi4 electronic structure package. Most of Psi4's core libraries (integral generation, SCF solver, etc.) are exposed to Python, which facilitates the development of short, easy to understand codes for complex electronic structure methods.

    "## The CIS Wave Function and Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "At the Hartree-Fock level of theory, the $N$-electron wave function is approximated as an antisymmetrized product of $N$ one-electron functions called molecular orbitals (MOs) (a Slater determinant). The simplest representation of an excited-state wave function would be a single Slater determinant comprised of a different set of MOs, but we can obtain a slightly better description of the excited state by expressing it as a linear combination of Slater determinants that differ by the ground-state configuration by one electron (*i.e.*, singly-excited confugurations).  What we are describing here is a configuration interaction with single excitations (CIS) wave function; the CIS wave function for the $n$th  excited state can be expressed as\n",
