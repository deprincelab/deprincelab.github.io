    "# Configuration Interaction with Single Excitations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will learn how to write a restricted configuration interaction with single excitations (CIS) code using the Python interface to the Psi4 electronic structure package. Most of Psi4's core libraries (integral generation, SCF solver, etc.) are exposed to Python, which facilitates the development of short, easy to understand codes for complex electronic structure methods. For example, you will soon find that it is possible to write a working CIS code in Python in less than 100 lines!"
