Programming Projects: Unrestricted Kohn-Sham DFT<br>
<hr>

<br>
<br> 
Overview 
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;
width:50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>

In this project, you will develop an unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS) DFT code as a plugin
to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> electronic structure
package.  We will first develop an unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) algorithm using
the JK object in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>, which
is capable of building coulomb-like (J) and exchange-like (K) matrices for arbitrary densities.
Then, we will use <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>'s 
DFT functional and potential objects to turn the UHF code into a UKS DFT code.  This tutorial
assumes that you are familiar with the SCF procedure in general and have completed
the previous restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) tutorial that employed the JK object.

<br>
<br>

The C++ and Python code for this UKS plugin can be found 
<a href=mydft.tar.gz>here</a>.

Unrestricted Hartree Fock
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;
width:50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
Note: we use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units>atomic units</a> throughout this tutorial.
<br>
<br>
The previous Hartree-Fock tutorials introduced the idea of <i>restricted</i> Hartree-Fock theory, 
where it is assumed that the &alpha;- and &beta;-spin orbitals 
(and density matrices, Fock matrices, etc.) are
the same.  These assumptions simplify the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure.
Here, we lift that assumption and employ 
<i>unrestricted</i> Hartree-Fock theory, where &alpha;-
and &beta;-spin orbitals can be different.

At the UHF level of theory, the
total electronic energy is given by
<br>
$$E_\text{electronic} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mu\nu} D_{\mu\nu}^\alpha(h_{\mu\nu} + F^\alpha_{\mu\nu}) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mu\nu} D_{\mu\nu}^\beta(h_{\mu\nu} + F^\beta_{\mu\nu})$$
where <i>h</i> represents the core Hamiltonian matrix, 
<i>D<sup>&alpha;</sup></i> and <i>D<sup>&beta;</sup></i> represent the density matrices 
for &alpha;- and &beta;-spin electrons, respectively, and <i>F<sup>&alpha;</sup></i> and 
<i>F<sup>&beta;</sup></i> represent the Fock matrices for &alpha;- and &beta;-spin electrons, respectively.  
Here, the indices &mu; and &nu; represent atomic orbital (AO) basis functions.  
As in the previous
tutorials, the core Hamiltonian matrix is comprised of integrals that represent both the 
electron kinetic energy and the electron-nuclear potential energy, and the atomic 
orbital basis functions are not orthogonal.  

<br>
<br>
The &alpha;- and &beta;-spin Fock matrices are defined as
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu}^\alpha = h_{\mu\nu} + J_{\mu\nu}^\alpha + J_{\mu\nu}^\beta - K_{\mu\nu}^\alpha$$
and
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu}^\beta = h_{\mu\nu} + J_{\mu\nu}^\alpha + J_{\mu\nu}^\beta - K_{\mu\nu}^\beta$$
where J<sup>&alpha;</sup> and J<sup>&beta;</sup> are Coulomb matrices 
for &alpha;- and &beta;-spin electrons, respectively, defined as
<br>
$$J_{\mu\nu}^\alpha = \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma}^\alpha (\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma)$$
and
<br>
$$J_{\mu\nu}^\beta = \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma}^\beta (\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma)$$
Similarly, we define exchange matrices for &alpha;- and &beta;-spin electrons
as
<br>
$$K_{\mu\nu}^\alpha = \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma}^\alpha (\mu\sigma|\lambda\nu)$$
and
<br>
$$K_{\mu\nu}^\beta = \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma}^\beta (\mu\sigma|\lambda\nu)$$
As in RHF, the UHF wave function
is an antisymmetrized product of <i>N</i> molecular 
orbitals (MOs), and the energy is minimized with respect to 
variations in the shape of these MOs.  We separately 
expand the &alpha;- and &beta;-spin orbitals as linear
combinations of atomic orbitals as
<br>
$$\phi_i^\alpha = \sum_\mu C_{\mu i}^\alpha \chi_\mu$$
and
<br>
$$\phi_i^\beta = \sum_\mu C_{\mu i}^\beta \chi_\mu$$
where &chi;<sub>&mu;</sub> is an atomic orbital basis function, and the 
orbital expansion coefficients, C<sup>&alpha;</sup> and 
C<sup>&beta;</sup>, are the variable parameters in the SCF procedure.  
These orbitals then define the &alpha;- and &beta;-spin density 
matrices that are used to construct the Coulomb and exchange 
matrices.  The UHF density matrices are defined as
<br>
$$D_{\mu\nu}^\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\alpha} C_{\mu i}^\alpha C_{\nu i}^\alpha$$
and
<br>
$$D_{\mu\nu}^\beta = \sum_{i=1}^{N_\beta} C_{\mu i}^\beta C_{\nu i}^\beta$$
Here, <i>N<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and <i>N<sub>&beta;</sub></i> represent
the number of electrons of &alpha; and &beta; spin, respectively.  In the previous
RHF tutorials, the number of doubly occupied orbitals were determined 
from the molecule object.  Here, we will determine <i>N<sub>&alpha;</sub></i> and 
<i>N<sub>&beta;</sub></i> in a similar way:
<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // use the molecule to determine the total number of electrons
    int charge     = mol-&gtmolecular_charge();
    int nelectron  = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt mol-&gtnatom(); i++) {
        nelectron += (int)mol-&gtZ(i);
    }
    nelectron -= charge;

    // use the molecule to determine the multiplicity
    int multiplicity = mol-&gtmultiplicity();

    // assuming Ms = S, multiplicity = 2 * Ms + 1
    double ms = (multiplicity - 1 ) / 2;

    // Ms = 1/2 ( Na - Nb )
    // N  = Na + Nb

    int nalpha = ( nelectron + (int)(2 * ms) ) / 2;
    int nbeta  = nelectron - na;

</pre>
<br>



The UHF SCF procedure
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;
width:50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
The UHF SCF procedure is similar to the RHF procedure outlined
in the previous tutorials. We begin with
some guess for the initial orbitals.  In the simplest guess, we approximate
the &alpha;- and &beta;-spin Fock matrices with the core Hamiltonian:
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu}^\alpha = F_{\mu\nu}^\beta = h_{\mu\nu}$$
We then transform the Fock matrices to the orthogonal basis 
defined by L&ouml;wdin's symmetric orthogonalization, giving
<br>
$${\bf F}^{\alpha\prime} = ({\bf S}^{-1/2})^T {\bf F}^\alpha {\bf S}^{-1/2}$$
and
<br>
$${\bf F}^{\beta\prime} = ({\bf S}^{-1/2})^T {\bf F}^\beta {\bf S}^{-1/2}$$
Here, <b>S</b> represents the matrix of overlap integrals.  We diagonalize
the Fock matrices in the orthogonal basis to determine the eigenvectors
<br>
$${\bf F}^{\alpha\prime}{\bf C}^{\alpha \prime} = \epsilon_\alpha {\bf C}^{\alpha \prime}$$
and
<br>
$${\bf F}^{\beta\prime}{\bf C}^{\beta \prime} = \epsilon_\beta {\bf C}^{\beta \prime}$$
which are related to the orbital coefficients by a partial
back transformation to the original non-orthogonal basis, giving
<br>
$${\bf C}^\alpha = {\bf S}^{-1/2} {\bf C}^{\alpha \prime}$$
and
<br>
$${\bf C}^\beta = {\bf S}^{-1/2} {\bf C}^{\beta \prime}$$

When developing your code, you can check your results against
some reference data for a modified version of the input file
we used in the previous tutorials.  Here, we specify that the
molecule is a water molecule with a +1 charge.  
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    molecule {
    1 2
    O
    H 1 R
    H 1 R 2 A
  
    R = .9
    A = 104.5
    # add this line!
    symmetry c1
    }

    set {
      basis sto-3g
      # add these lines!
      scf_type df
      reference uhf
    }

    energy('myscf')

</pre>

<br>
Note that the reference has been specified as UHF. Check your initial 
<a href=cmat_a.txt>&alpha;-spin</a> and 
<a href=cmat_b.txt>&beta;-spin</a> guess orbitals for this case.
<br>
<br>

Now that we have a guess for the orbitals, we can build the &alpha;- and
&beta;-spin Fock matrices, which can be transformed to the orthogonal
basis and diagonalized to determine new orbitals.  The construction of the
Coulomb and exchange matrices is simplified when 
using <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>'s JK object.  For
UHF, the JK object is initialized in the same way as it was in the case of RHF.

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // JK object
    std::shared_ptr&ltDiskDFJK&gt jk = (std::shared_ptr&ltDiskDFJK&gt)(new DiskDFJK(primary,auxiliary));

    // memory for jk (say, 80% of what is available)
    jk-&gtset_memory(0.8 * Process::environment.get_memory());

    // integral cutoff
    jk-&gtset_cutoff(options.get_double("INTS_TOLERANCE"));

    // Do J/K, Not wK 
    jk-&gtset_do_J(true);
    jk-&gtset_do_K(true);
    jk-&gtset_do_wK(false);

    jk-&gtinitialize();
</pre>
<br>

Since we do not (yet) require the wK matrices for range-separated DFT, we
initialize the JK object to compute only Coulomb and exchange matrices.  During
the SCF iterations, the JK object can build both &alpha;- and &beta;-spin
matrices; the way we achieve this is by passing both &alpha;- and &beta;-spin
orbital coefficients to the object:

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        // grab occupied alpha orbitals (the first nalpha)
        std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt myCa (new Matrix(Ca) );
        myCa-&gtzero();

        // grab occupied beta orbitals (the first nbeta)
        std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt myCb (new Matrix(Cb) );
        myCb-&gtzero();

        for (int mu = 0; mu &lt nso; mu++) {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt nalpha; i++) {
                myCa-&gtpointer()[mu][i] = Ca-&gtpointer()[mu][i];
            }
            for (int i = 0; i &lt nbeta; i++) {
                myCb-&gtpointer()[mu][i] = Cb-&gtpointer()[mu][i];
            }
        }

        // push occupied orbitals onto JK object
        std::vector&lt std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt &gt& C_left  = jk-&gtC_left();
        C_left.clear();
        C_left.push_back(myCa);
        C_left.push_back(myCb);

        // form J/K
        jk-&gtcompute();

        // form Fa = h + Ja + Jb - Ka
        Fa-&gtcopy(h);
        Fa-&gtadd(jk-&gtJ()[0]);
        Fa-&gtadd(jk-&gtJ()[1]);
        Fa-&gtsubtract(jk-&gtK()[0]);

        // form Fb = h + Ja + Jb - Kb
        Fb-&gtcopy(h);
        Fb-&gtadd(jk-&gtJ()[0]);
        Fb-&gtadd(jk-&gtJ()[1]);
        Fb-&gtsubtract(jk-&gtK()[1]);
</pre>

<br>

The jk->J() and jk->K() functions return standard vectors of matrices; if two 
sets of orbitals are pushed onto the JK object as was done above, then the 
first matrix in each standard vector correspondes to &alpha; spin, and the 
second matrix in each vector corresponds to &beta; spin.  You can check your
<a href=coulomb_a.txt>&alpha;-spin</a> and 
<a href=coulomb_b.txt>&beta;-spin</a> Coulomb matrices for the first SCF
iteration using the input file given above.

<br>
<br>
Convergence is monitored in UHF in the same way that it is monitored in 
RHF.  The UHF SCF procedure is considered converged when the energy 
and orbitals cease to change between iterations or when the orbital
gradient becomes sufficiently small.
Further, as was done in the <a href=https://www.chem.fsu.edu/~deprince/programming_projects/diis/>previous tutorial</a>, the convergence can be accelerated 
using the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS) procedure.  If 
you want to use DIIS here, do not extrapolate the &alpha; and &beta; Fock
matrices separately.  Instead, use a single DIIS extrapolation with vectors
of twice the dimension of those used in the RHF-based DIIS tutorial.

For the input file given above, the UHF procedure with DIIS should converge
the energy and RMS orbital gradient to 12 decimal places in 14 iterations.

Unrestricted Kohn-Sham DFT
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;
width:50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>

In Kohn-Sham DFT, we hold that the electronic energy is a universal functional 
of the one-electron density and, further, there exists a fictitious 
noninteracting system of electrons that has the same density as the true set 
of electrons.  The states of the fictitious system are determined in a manner
that is similar to Hartree-Fock theory; the Kohn-Sham wave function is
a single antisymmetrized product of Kohn-Sham orbitals, and these orbitals
are determined as the eigenvectors of an effective one-electron operator
that accounts for true many-body effects.  The unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS)
energy is
<br>
<!--$$E_\text{Kohn-Sham} = \sum_{\mu\nu} D_{\mu\nu}^\alpha(h_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2}[J^\alpha_{\mu\nu} + J^\beta_{\mu\nu}] ) + \sum_{\mu\nu} D_{\mu\nu}^\beta(h_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2}[J^\alpha_{\mu\nu} + J^\beta_{\mu\nu}] ) + E_{\rm xc}[\rho_\alpha, \rho_\beta]$$-->
$$E_\text{Kohn-Sham} = \sum_\sigma \sum_{\mu\nu} D_{\mu\nu}^\sigma(h_{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2}[J^\alpha_{\mu\nu} + J^\beta_{\mu\nu}] ) + E_{\rm xc}[\rho_\alpha, \rho_\beta]$$
where &sigma; represents the spin for the electron (&alpha; or &beta;), \(E_\text{xc}\) represents the exchange-correlation energy functional, and
&rho;<sub>&alpha;</sub> and &rho;<sub>&beta;</sub> represent the &alpha; and
&beta; spin densities, respectively.  These spin densities are the real-space
representation of the densities, defined as
<br>
$$\rho_\alpha({\bf r}) = \sum_{\mu\nu}D_{\mu\nu}^\alpha \chi_\mu({\bf r}) \chi_\nu({\bf r})$$
and
<br>
$$\rho_\beta({\bf r}) = \sum_{\mu\nu}D_{\mu\nu}^\beta \chi_\mu({\bf r}) \chi_\nu({\bf r})$$

The simplest exchange-correlation functionals depend only on the
spin densities; these functionals are categorized as Local Spin-Density
Approximations (LSDA).  Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals
also depend on the gradient of the spin densities.  More complicated
functionals can be developed by considering also the second derivative of the
spin density (these are meta GGA functionals).  Kohn-Sham functionals can be 
further generalized
to include some percentage (usually denoted by &alpha;) 
of "exact" Hartree-Fock exchange; in such "hybrid"
functionals, the electronic energy also includes contributions from the usual
Hartree-Fock exchange matrices.  Lastly, one can also devise so-called 
long-range corrected (LRC) functionals that use Hartree-Fock exchange at 
long range and the density functional approximation to exchange at short range; 
of course, in this
case, one much choose some scheme to partition space to distinguish between
"short-" and "long-range" interactions.  The usual choice is the error function,
erf(&omega;r<sub>12</sub>), where &omega; is the range-separation parameter.  
The general form of the exchange-correlation energy then involves integrals
over the exchange-correlation functional and the short/long-range components
of the exchange; see the section of the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> manual on <a href=http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dft.html>DFT</a> for more detail.

<br>
<br>

In practice, the unrestricted Kohn-Sham DFT orbitals are optimized in a way
that is very similar to the UHF procedure.  Rather than diagonalizing the
UHF Fock matrices to determine our orbitals, we diagonalize Kohn-Sham
matrices, which have a similar form
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu}^\sigma = h_{\mu\nu} + J_{\mu\nu}^\alpha + J_{\mu\nu}^\beta -\alpha K_{\mu\nu}^\sigma - (1-\alpha)K_{\mu\nu}^{\sigma,\omega} + V_{\mu\nu}^{\text{xc},\alpha}$$
Here, &sigma; represents the spin for the electron (&alpha; or &beta;), &alpha;
represents the percentage of exact Hartree-Fock exchange, 
K<sup>&sigma;,&omega;</sup> represents an exchange matrix generated with the 
operator erf(&omega;r<sub>12</sub>)/r<sub>12</sub>, as opposed to the usual 
Coulomb operator, 1/r<sub>12</sub>, and V<sup>xc,&alpha;</sup> represents
the exchange-correlation potential matrix, which is comprised of integrals over
derivatives of the exchange-correlation functional.  For more detail as
to what actually goes into V<sup>xc,&alpha;</sup>, 
see <a href=http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/dft.html>here</a>.

<br>
<br>
So!  All we need to do to turn our UHF code into a UKS code is figure out how
to grab from <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> each of 
the DFT-specific quantities that comprise the Kohn-Sham 
matrices and energy.  
<br>
<br>

Modifying your UHF code
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;width:50%">
</div>

<br>
<br>

The first thing we need to do is modify the Python sequence that calls 
the UHF/UKS plugin in order to be sure that the plugin knows which DFT
functional to use.  Open the file pymodule.py.  Comment out the portions
that compute the SCF reference wave function that is passed to the plugin.
This reference will not contain any information about the DFT functional
for the UKS procedure, so we must create a reference wave function
that contains this information.  Modify your Python run sequence to
match the one given below.  

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    # Your plugin's psi4 run sequence goes here

    # determine dft functional from options
    func = psi4.core.get_option('MYSCF','FUNCTIONAL')

    # comment out or remove the lines below that compute the
    # scf reference.  we will construct our own wave function.

    # Compute a SCF reference, a wavefunction is return which holds the molecule used, orbitals
    # Fock matrices, and more
    #print('Attention! This SCF may be density-fitted.')

    #ref_wfn = kwargs.get('ref_wfn', None)
    #if ref_wfn is None:
    #    ref_wfn = psi4.driver.scf_helper(name, **kwargs)

    # add these lines below to create a wave function to pass to the plugin

    scf_molecule = kwargs.get('molecule', psi4.core.get_active_molecule())
    base_wfn = psi4.core.Wavefunction.build(scf_molecule, psi4.core.get_global_option('BASIS'))
    scf_wfn = proc.scf_wavefunction_factory(psi4.core.get_option('SCF', 'REFERENCE'), base_wfn, func)


    # Ensure IWL files have been written when not using DF/CD
    proc_util.check_iwl_file_from_scf_type(psi4.core.get_option('SCF', 'SCF_TYPE'), scf_wfn)

    # Call the Psi4 plugin
    # Please note that setting the reference wavefunction in this way is ONLY for plugins
    myscf_wfn = psi4.core.plugin('myscf.so', scf_wfn)
</pre>

<br>
Note that the proc.scf_wavefunction_factory.build() call is not accessible using the
standard plugin template generated via "psi4 --plugin-name mydft".  At the top
of pymodule.py, you must import an additional library as

<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

from psi4.driver.procrouting import proc
</pre>

<br>

Note also that there is a line above asking the options object for information about 
the functional.  This option will be specific to your plugin and needs to 
be added to the C++ code in the function int read_options(std::string name, Options& options):

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        /*- DFT functional -*/
        options.add_str("FUNCTIONAL", "B3LYP");
</pre>
<br>

The default functional will be B3LYP.  You will also need to include two additional headers
in order to use the DFT functional and potential objects.  Add the following headers to 
your C++ code containing your UHF procedure:
<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

// for dft
#include "psi4/libfock/v.h"
#include "psi4/libfunctional/superfunctional.h"
</pre>

<br>

Find the portion of your code where you initialized your JK object, and 
add the following lines to determine the functional and to initialize 
the DFT potential object, <i>before</i>
you initialize the JK object:

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // determine the DFT functional and initialize the potential object
    scf::HF* scfwfn = (scf::HF*)ref_wfn.get();
    std::shared_ptr&ltSuperFunctional&gt functional = scfwfn-&gtfunctional();
    std::shared_ptr&ltVBase&gt potential = 
        VBase::build_V(primary,functional,options,
        (options.get_str("REFERENCE") == "RKS" ? "RV" : "UV"));

    potential-&gtinitialize();

    // print the ks information
    potential-&gtprint_header();
</pre>

<br>
Now, when initializing the JK object, the functional object can
tell us whether or not the JK object needs to compute the 
exchange matrices necessary for hybrid or LRC functionals:

<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    // JK object
    std::shared_ptr&ltDiskDFJK&gt jk = (std::shared_ptr&ltDiskDFJK&gt)(new DiskDFJK(primary,auxiliary));

    // memory for jk (say, 80% of what is available)
    jk-&gtset_memory(0.8 * Process::environment.get_memory());

    // integral cutoff
    jk-&gtset_cutoff(options.get_double("INTS_TOLERANCE"));

    // Do J.
    jk-&gtset_do_J(true);

    // Do K?
    jk-&gtset_do_K(functional-&gtis_x_hybrid());

    // Do wK?
    jk-&gtset_do_wK(functional-&gtis_x_lrc());
    jk-&gtset_omega(functional-&gtx_omega());

    jk-&gtinitialize();
</pre>

<br>

With the JK and potential objects properly initialized, we are ready
to modify the UHF procedure.  Locate the portion of your UHF 
procedure where the J and K matrices are formed

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        // form J/K
        jk-&gtcompute();
</pre>

<br>

For every DFT functional, the Fock matrices will
include the core Hamiltonian and Coulomb matrices.  Ask your functional
object if you need to include exact exchange, and do so, if necessary

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        // exact exchange?
        if (functional-&gtis_x_hybrid()) {
            // form F -= alpha K
            double alpha = functional-&gtx_alpha();
            Fa-&gtaxpy(-alpha,jk-&gtK()[0]);
            Fb-&gtaxpy(-alpha,jk-&gtK()[1]);
        }
</pre>

<br>

If you are using a LRC functional, you must also include the exchange matrix 
generated with the modified erf integrals:

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        // LRC functional?
        if (functional-&gtis_x_lrc()) {
            // form Fa/b -= beta wKa/b
            double beta = 1.0 - functional-&gtx_alpha();
            Fa-&gtaxpy(-beta,jk-&gtwK()[0]);
            Fb-&gtaxpy(-beta,jk-&gtwK()[1]);
        }
</pre>

<br>

Lastly, we will need to include
the exchange-correlation potential, which is computed by the potential object.
The potential object needs to know the current &alpha; and &beta; densities;
once you have built these from your occupied &alpha; and &beta; orbitals,
you can pass them to the potential object using its "set_D" function.

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        if (functional-&gtneeds_xc()) {

            // set a/b densities in potential object
            potential-&gtset_D({Da_, Db_});

            // evaluate a/b potentials
            potential-&gtcompute_V({Va_,Vb_});

            // form Fa/b = h + Ja + Jb + Va/b
            Fa_-&gtadd(Va_);
            Fb_-&gtadd(Vb_);

        }
</pre>

<br>

Note that Va_ and Vb_ are not members of the Wavefunction class, so you 
will need to declare and allocate memory for them somewhere.  
Check your <a href=potential_a.txt>&alpha;-</a> and <a href=potential_b.txt>&beta;-spin</a> 
exchange correlation
potential matrices from the first UKS iteration (these matrices 
correspond to the same molecule and basis set given above 
and the B3LYP functional).

<br>
<br>

The remaining steps of the UKS procedure are identical to those 
of the UHF procedure, with one minor exception.  When computing
the energy, be sure to check whether or not your functional
requires exact exchange or is a range-separated functional, and
include those contributions as necessary.  The exchange-correlation
energy can be grabbed from the potential object as

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        double exchange_correlation_energy = 0.0;
        if (functional-&gtneeds_xc()) {
            exchange_correlation_energy = potential-&gtquadrature_values()["FUNCTIONAL"];
        }
</pre>

<br>
If everything is working correctly, and you are using DIIS extrapolation, then
the UKS procedure should converge to 12 decimal places in 14 iterations:
