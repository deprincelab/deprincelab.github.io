Programming Projects: SCF with the JK object<br>
    
<hr>

<br>
<br> 
Overview 
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;
width:50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>

In this project, you will learn how to write a restricted Hartree-Fock
self-consistent field (SCF) solver as a plugin to the 
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> electronic structure
package.  The solver will make use of the <b> JK object </b> in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>, which 
is capable of building coulomb-like (J) and exchange-like (K) matrices for arbitrary densities.  
The JK object can also make use of conventional, density-fitted, or Cholesky-decomposed
electron repulsion integrals.  If you would like to see how J and K can 
explicitly be built, see <a href="../scf/index.php">this tutorial</a>.

<br>
<br>

For a 
tutorial that does not require the use of <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>, see Daniel Crawford's 
<a href=https://sirius.chem.vt.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=crawdad:programming:project3>SCF project</a> (this project was adapted from that one).  That project
does not use density fitting, and all required integrals are read from
text files so that your code can be written independently of any 
electronic structure package.
<br>
<br>
For additional information about the SCF procedure, I recommend Szabo and
Ostlund's awesome (and cheap!) book <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Quantum-Chemistry-Introduction-Electronic/dp/0486691861/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434159017&sr=8-1&keywords=szabo+ostlund>Modern Quantum Chemistry</a> or David Sherrill's
<a href=http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/hf-intro/hf-intro.pdf>online notes</a>.

Note: we use <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_units>atomic units</a> throughout this tutorial.
<br>
<br>
At the Hartree-Fock level of theory, the <i>N</i>-electron wave function
is approximated as an antisymmetrized product of <i>N</i> one-electron 
functions called molecular orbitals (MOs).  We call this type of wave function 
a Slater
determinant, and the associated electronic energy can be expressed as
<br>
$$E_\text{electronic} = \sum_{\mu\nu} D_{\mu\nu} (h_{\mu\nu} + F_{\mu\nu})$$
where <i>D</i> represents a <b>density matrix</b> (defined below),
<i>h</i> represents the <b>core Hamiltonian matrix</b>, and <i>F</i>
represents the <b>Fock matrix</b>.  Here, Greek indices represent
<b> atomic orbital (AO)</b> basis functions.  The core Hamiltonian matrix 
contains integrals that represent the <b>kinetic energy</b> of 
an electron (<i>T</i>)
and <b>electron-nuclear potential energy</b> (<i>V</i>):
<br>
$$h_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu} + V_{\mu\nu}$$
The matrix elements of the kinetic energy are integrals over the real-valued
AO basis functions,  &chi;, with the quantum-mechanical 
kinetic energy operator:
<br>
$$T_{\mu\nu} = -\frac{1}{2}\int \chi_\mu({\bf r}) \nabla^2_{\bf r} \chi_\nu({\bf r}) d{\bf r}$$
We should note here that these basis functions are <i> not </i> 
orthogonal, and we define the <b> overlap matrix </b>, <i>S</i>, as
<br>
$$S_{\mu\nu} = \int \chi_\mu({\bf r}) \chi_\nu({\bf r}) d{\bf r}$$
The matrix elements of the electron-nuclear potential energy are integrals 
over
basis functions with the potential energy operator (<i>Z/r</i>):
<br>
$$V_{\mu\nu} = -\int \chi_\mu({\bf r}) \left ( \sum_A \frac{Z_A}{r_A} \right ) \chi_\nu({\bf r}) d{\bf r}$$
Here, there are multiple nuclei, labeled <i>A</i>, with 
nuclear charge <i>Z<sub>A</sub></i> and a distance from the electron of
<i>r<sub>A</sub></i>.  The Fock matrix is defined as
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu} + \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma}[ 2(\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma) - (\mu\sigma|\lambda\nu)]$$
where the symbol, (<i>&mu;&nu;|&lambda;&sigma;</i>) represents a <b>
two-electron repulsion integral</b>, defined as
<br>
$$(\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma) = \int \chi_\mu({\bf r}_1) \chi_\nu({\bf r}_1) \frac{1}{r_{12}} \chi_\lambda({\bf r}_2) \chi_\sigma({\bf r}_2) d{\bf r}_1 d{\bf r}_2 $$
The actual working equations for Hartree-Fock theory are derived
by considering a constrained minimization of the electronic energy
with respect to the shape of the molecular orbitals, <i>&phi;</i>,
which are expanded as a linear combination of atomic orbitals:
<br>
$$\phi_i = \sum_\mu C_{\mu i} \chi_\mu $$
Using Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers, the electronic
energy is minimized with respect to the elements of <b>C</b> 
subject to the constraint that the molecular orbitals form an
orthonormal set.  Eventually, these considerations lead to an
eigenvalue problem; the molecular orbitals are the eigenvectors
of the Fock matrix, and the corresponding eigenvalues (which 
are the multipliers) are
interpreted as the molecular orbital energies.
<br>
<br>
We now develop a computational procedure for determining the 
molecular orbitals
and the electronic energy with the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> electronic structure package.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Procedure:
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;
width:50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Step 1.  Create a new plugin</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Create a new plugin, as described <a href=http://www.chem.fsu.edu/~deprince/programming_projects/getting_started.php>here</a>.  If you called your plugin 
"myscf," then all of your code can be placed inside plugin.cc.  Open plugin.cc
and locate the myscf(Options & options) function:
<br>
<br>
    
<pre class="prettyprint">
    
    extern "C"
    SharedWavefunction myscf(SharedWavefunction ref_wfn, Options& options)
    {
        int print = options.get_int("PRINT");

        /* Your code goes here */

        // Typically you would build a new wavefunction and populate it with data
        return ref_wfn;
    }
</pre>
<br>
Like the comment says, your code goes there!
<br>
<br>
Before moving on, open the input file in your plugin directory (input.dat) 
and look at the molecule block
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    molecule {
    O
    H 1 R
    H 1 R 2 A

    R = .9
    A = 104.5
    # add this line!
    symmetry c1
    }

</pre>
<br>
This plugin will not make use of point group symmetry, so you 
should add a line specifying that the computation be performed 
using C<sub>1</sub> symmetry.  Now, add a flag indicating that the
computation will use density fitting techniques:
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

set {
  # add this line!
  scf_type df
  basis sto-3g
}
</pre>
<br>
For the remainder of this 
project, I've assumed that the rest of the input is unchanged.
Keep this in mind when comparing to my results.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<u>Step 2.  Obtain 1-electron integrals</u>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, close input.dat and open plugin.cc.  In order to use
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>'s built-in
integral libraries, matrix classes, etc., we must include the corresponding
headers at the top of the file.  Add the following headers:
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

#include "psi4/libmints/wavefunction.h"
#include "psi4/libmints/mintshelper.h"
#include "psi4/libmints/matrix.h"
#include "psi4/libmints/vector.h"
#include "psi4/libmints/basisset.h"
#include "psi4/libmints/molecule.h"
#include "psi4/lib3index/dftensor.h"
#include "psi4/libqt/qt.h"

// blas calls (in addition to those from Matrix/Vector classes)
#include "psi4/libqt/qt.h"

// jk object
#include "psi4/libfock/jk.h"
</pre>
<br>
We can now use <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>'s 
MintsHelper class to grab all of the one-electron integrals we'll need
inside the function SharedWavefunction myscf(SharedWavefunction ref_wfn, Options& options).
<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // grab the one-electron integrals from MintsHelper:
    std::shared_ptr&ltMintsHelper&gt mints (new MintsHelper(ref_wfn));

    // one-electron kinetic energy integrals
    std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt T = mints-&gtso_kinetic();

    // one-electron potential energy integrals
    std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt V = mints-&gtso_potential();

    // overlap integrals
    std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt S = mints-&gtso_overlap();

    // build the core hamiltonian
    std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt h = (std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt)(new Matrix(T));
    h-&gtadd(V);
</pre>
<br>

Note that all of the MintsHelper functions we call all have the prefix "so," 
which stands for "symmetry orbital."  The SO basis is obtained by transforming
the AO basis functions so that the SOs belong to a proper irreducible 
representation in the molecule's point group.  If we are
not using symmetry (which is the case here), then the AO and SO bases are
equivalent.
<br>
<br>
<br>

<u>Step 3.  Initialize the JK object</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At this point, we need to initialize the JK object, which is 
responsible for building our coulomb and exchange matrices.
In order to initialize the JK object, we will need (1) the 
molecule object, (2) the 
primary basis set, (3) the auxiliary (or density-fitting) basis set.
<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // grab the molecule from the wavefunction that was passed into the plugin
    std::shared_ptr&ltMolecule&gt mol = ref_wfn-&gtmolecule();

    // get primary basis:
    std::shared_ptr&ltBasisSet&gt primary = ref_wfn-&gtget_basisset("ORBITAL");

    // total number of basis functions
    int nso = primary-&gtnbf();

    // get auxiliary basis:
    std::shared_ptr&ltBasisSet&gt auxiliary = ref_wfn-&gtget_basisset("DF_BASIS_SCF");

    // total number of auxiliary basis functions
    int nQ = auxiliary-&gtnbf();
</pre>
<br>

Note that we are using the strings "ORBITAL" and "DF_BASIS_SCF" when we
grab the primary and
auxiliary basis sets.  What are these?
<br>
<br>
The primary basis set ("ORBITAL") should be set in the input file (e.g. "set basis sto-3g").  It was
automatically set to STO-3G
when you generated your plugin (check if you don't believe me!).
The auxiliary basis set ("DF_BASIS_SCF") can be specified in the input file,
but it was
not automatically set when the plugin was created.  Fortunately, since we
requested that the scf_type be "DF",
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> is smart enough to pick a DF basis for you.  If
no "DF_BASIS_SCF" was specified in the input, then <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> picks the "JKFIT"
variant of the primary "ORBITAL" basis that it
deems appropriate.  For the STO-3G basis, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span> will choose smallest possible "JK
FIT" set, def2-svp-jkfit.
<br>
<br>
Moving on!
<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // JK object
    std::shared_ptr&ltDiskDFJK&gt jk = (std::shared_ptr&ltDiskDFJK&gt)(new DiskDFJK(primary,auxiliary));

    // memory for jk (say, 80% of what is available)
    jk-&gtset_memory(0.8 * Process::environment.get_memory());

    // integral cutoff
    jk-&gtset_cutoff(options.get_double("INTS_TOLERANCE"));

    // Do J/K, Not wK 
    jk-&gtset_do_J(true);
    jk-&gtset_do_K(true);
    jk-&gtset_do_wK(false);

    jk-&gtinitialize();
</pre>
<br>

Here, we have set up the JK object to build the coulomb and exchange matrices, but we are not building any matrices associated with range-separated DFT (wK). Note that our JK object will use density fitting (DFJK), but you could have initialized the class to use conventional 4-index integrals or Cholesky-decomposed integrals.  See the <a href=https://github.com/psi4/psi4/blob/master/psi4/src/psi4/libfock/jk.h>jk.h</a> header file for more information.

<br>
<br>

Since this tutorial is designed for closed-shell systems, we should check to
be sure that the number of electrons is even.

<pre class="prettyprint">

    // use the molecule to determine the total number of electrons
    int charge     = mol-&gtmolecular_charge();
    int nelectron  = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt mol-&gtnatom(); i++) {
        nelectron += (int)mol-&gtZ(i);
    }
    nelectron -= charge;

    // this code only works for closed shells
    if ( nelectron % 2 != 0 ) {
        throw PsiException("plugin myscf only works for closed shells",__FILE__,__LINE__);
    }

    // the number of doubly occupied orbitals (or alpha electrons)
    int na = nelectron / 2;

</pre>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<u>Step 4.  Symmetric orthogonalization</u>
<br>
<br>
Oftentimes in electronic structure theory, we would prefer to 
work within a basis of orthonormal functions, which
simplifies the math.  However, our SO basis functions
are not orthogonal.  We can generate an orthogonal 
basis via L&ouml;wdin's symmetric orthogonalization.  One
first finds a transformation that diagonalizes the overlap
matrix, <b>S</b>,
<br>
$${\bf s} = {\bf U}^T{\bf S}{\bf U}$$
where <b>s</b> is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.  We then
construct the symmetric orthogonalization matrix by taking
the inverse square root of the eigenvalues and backtransforming
them to the original basis.
<br>
$${\bf S}^{-1/2} = {\bf U}{\bf s}^{-1/2}{\bf U}^T$$
The following code snippet illustrates how to diagonalize the
overlap matrix using <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>'s Matrix class. The back 
transformation is performed using a built-in function in 
the Matrix class.
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    // allocate memory for eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the overlap matrix
    std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt Sevec ( new Matrix(nso,nso) );
    std::shared_ptr&ltVector&gt Seval ( new Vector(nso) );

    // build S^(-1/2) symmetric orthogonalization matrix
    S->diagonalize(Sevec,Seval);

    std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt Shalf = (std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt)( new Matrix(nso,nso) );
    for (int mu = 0; mu < nso; mu++) {
        Shalf->pointer()[mu][mu] = 1.0 / sqrt(Seval->pointer()[mu]);
    }

    // transform Seval back to nonorthogonal basis
    Shalf->back_transform(Sevec);
</pre>
<br>
Note that Shalf->pointer() gives you access to the underlying data in the Matrix class.  Check your <a href=shalf.txt><b>S</b><sup>-1/2</sup> matrix</a> using the Shalf->print() function.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Step 5.  Guess orbitals, density, and energy</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To obtain a set of guess orbitals and an initial density, we approximate
the initial Fock matrix as the core Hamiltonian
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu}$$
Next, use the symmetric orthogonalization matrix to bring this
Fock matrix to a basis of orthonormal functions
<br>
$${\bf F}^\prime = ({\bf S}^{-1/2})^T {\bf F}{\bf S}^{-1/2}$$
Check your <a href=fprime.txt><b>F</b>' matrix</a>.
<br>
<br>
We will now diagonalize this transformed Fock matrix to determine
its eigenvectors (the molecular orbitals, <b>C</b>') and eigenvalues
(the molecular orbital energies, <i>&epsilon;</i>)
<br>
$${\bf F}^\prime {\bf C}^\prime = \epsilon {\bf C}^\prime$$
The matrix <b>C</b>' represents the molecular orbitals as a linear
combination of orthonormalized basis functions, but what we really
want is the linear combination of nonorthogonal AO (or SO) basis functions.
We need to back transform one index of <b>C</b>' to the original
AO basis
<br>
$${\bf C} = {\bf S}^{-1/2} {\bf C}^\prime$$
Since you are only transforming one index, don't use the Matrix class back_transform()
call.  You could use the Matrix class gemm() call
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

        // allocate memory for SO->MO coefficients
        std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt Ca = (std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt)(new Matrix(nso,nso));

        // Find C = S^(-1/2)C'
        Ca->gemm(false,false,1.0,Shalf,Fevec,0.0);
</pre>
<br>
<br>
where Fevec is a Matrix containing the eigenvectors of <b>F</b>'.
Alternatively, you could grab the appropriate pointers 
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

        double ** cp = Ca->pointer();
        double ** sp = Shalf->pointer();
        double ** fp = Fprime->pointer();
</pre>
<br>
<br>
and transform that index using explicit loops.
Check your <a href=cmat.txt>MO coefficients</a>.
<br>
<br>
Now, we define the density matrix as the contraction of the 
molecular orbital coefficients over the <i>N/2</i> lowest-energy 
molecular orbitals (the doubly occupied orbitals):
<br>
$$D_{\mu\nu} = \sum_i^{\text{occ}} C_{\mu i} C_{\nu i}$$
This density can then be used to evaluate the initial electronic energy
and to obtain a new Fock matrix.
<br>
<br>
Check your <a href=dmat.txt>density</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Step 6.  The SCF procedure</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You may have noticed that the Fock matrix depends on the density:
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu} + \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma}[ 2(\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma) - (\mu\sigma|\lambda\nu)]$$
and the density is determined by diagonalizing the Fock matrix.  If
this seems a bit circular, you're right;
we must determine the density for the system <b> self-consistently</b>.  We
repeatedly construct and diagonalize the Fock matrix until the electronic
energy and density matrix cease to change.  The self-consistent nature
of the solution is the source of the name of the procedure: the 
Hartree-Fock self-consistent field procedure.  
<br>
<br>
The SCF procedure is quite simple.  Repeat Step 5, but use the correct 
Fock matrix (rather than the core Hamiltonian), until the changes in the energy
and the density between iterations fall below some threshold.
<br>
<br>
Programming this expression is a little more manageable if 
we write the Fock
matrix in terms of the <b> coulomb </b> and <b> exchange </b> 
matrices, <i>J</i> and <i>K</i>
<br>
$$F_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu} + 2J_{\mu\nu} - K_{\mu\nu}$$
where
<br>
$$J_{\mu\nu} = \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma} (\mu\nu|\lambda\sigma)  $$
and 
<br>
$$K_{\mu\nu} = \sum_{\lambda\sigma} D_{\lambda\sigma} (\mu\sigma|\lambda\nu)  $$
We will use the JK object to build the coulomb and exchange matrices.  The
JK object expects to build the density itself, so we need to pass the
molecular orbital coefficients for the <i>N/2</i> lowest-energy orbitals to it.
<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        // grab occupied orbitals (the first na)
        std::shared_ptr&ltMatrix&gt myC (new Matrix(Ca) );
        myC-&gtzero();

        for (int mu = 0; mu &lt nso; mu++) {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt na; i++) {
                myC-&gtpointer()[mu][i] = Ca-&gtpointer()[mu][i];
            }
        }

        // push occupied orbitals onto JK object
        std::vector&ltSharedMatrix&gt& C_left  = jk-&gtC_left();
        C_left.clear();
        C_left.push_back(myC);

</pre>

<br>

If we only push the left Ca matrix onto the JK object, it will assume
that the right Ca matrix is the same.  Note that the JK object <i>could</i>
take different left and right Ca matrices.  Also, it is possible to 
push more than one set of molecular orbital coefficients onto the JK
object, in case you ever want to build multiple J and K matrices 
simultaneously.  
Now, actually building the J and K matrices is easy:

<br>
<br>

<pre class="prettyprint">

        // form J/K
        jk-&gtcompute();

        // form F = h + 2*J - K
        Fa-&gtcopy(jk-&gtJ()[0]);
        Fa-&gtscale(2.0);
        Fa-&gtsubtract(jk-&gtK()[0]);
        Fa-&gtadd(h);
</pre>

<br>
Check your <a href=coulomb.txt>coulomb</a>, <a href=exchange.txt>exchange</a>,
and <a href=fock.txt>Fock</a> matrices from the first SCF iteration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Step 7. Monitoring convergence</u>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The SCF procedure is considered converged when the changes in the
energy and density between iterations fall below some predefined thresholds.
In <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Psi4</span>, these convergence thresholds can be specified in the input
file and obtained in your plugin from the "options" object:
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    // grab some input options
    double e_convergence = options.get_double("E_CONVERGENCE");
    double d_convergence = options.get_double("D_CONVERGENCE");
</pre>
<br>
<br>
During the SCF procedure, we must monitor the change in the energy between 
iterations <i>k</i>-1 and <i>k</i>
<br>
$$\Delta E = | E_k - E_{k-1}|$$
as well as the change in the density
<br>
$$\Delta D = \left ( \sum_{\mu\nu} (D^k_{\mu\nu} - D^{k-1}_{\mu\nu}) \right )^{1/2}$$
For the present molecule/basis set, the energy and density 
should converge to 8 decimal places in about 20 iterations:
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">
