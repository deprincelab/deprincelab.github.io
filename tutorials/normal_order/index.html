In this project, you will learn how to use the <a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq/>pdaggerq</a>
project to bring complicated strings of second-quantized operators to normal order, relative to both the true vacuum state
 and the Fermi vacuum. You will generate singles and doubles amplitudes equations for coupled cluster with
single and double excitations (CCSD). You can also follow a video version of this tutorial, here, but note that much of the
syntax used in pdaggerq has changed since that video was made:

Many-body quantum chemistry methods are often formulated using second-quantized
creation and annihiliation operators. Second-quantized operators give us compact
representations of many-body wave functions, and the antisymmetry properties
of fermionic wave functions are cooked into the anti commutation relations for
the operators.  We have
<br>
$$\hat{a}_p^{\dagger}\hat{a}_q + \hat{a}_q \hat{a}_p^{\dagger} = \delta_{pq}$$
$$\hat{a}_p^{\dagger}\hat{a}_q^{\dagger} + \hat{a}_q^{\dagger} \hat{a}_p^{\dagger} = 0$$
and
<br>
$$\hat{a}_p \hat{a}_q + \hat{a}_q \hat{a}_p = 0$$
where \(\hat{a}_p^{\dagger}\) and \(\hat{a}_p\) represent creation and annihilation operators, respectively. Oftentimes, we encounter products of creation
and annihilation operators that are more conveniently dealt with when in
so-called "normal order," that is, when all of the creation operators lie
to the left of the annihilation operators (note that this definition of normal order is relative to the true vacuum state, 
whereas normal order relative to the Fermi vacuum is slightly different and will be discussed below). Bringing a string of operators to
normal order is straightforward enough, given the anti-commutator relations 
obeyed by the operators.
The challenge is really just that the application of these rules can
become tedious. Thankfully, computers are well suited for tedious tasks.
<br>
<br>
We have developed a tool (<a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq/>pdaggerq</a>)
that allows one to simply define
and rearrange complicated strings of creation and annihilation operators within
a Python interface. For example, the following Python code will evaluate the
expression
<br>
$$\hat{a}_i^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j \hat{a}_l^{\dagger} \hat{a}_k$$
<pre class="prettyprint">

    import pdaggerq
   
    pq = pdaggerq.pq_helper("true")

    pq.set_print_level(1)

    pq.set_string(['i*','j','l*','k'])
    pq.add_new_string()

    pq.simplify()
    pq.print()
</pre>
<br>
which when executed prints
<br>
<br>
<pre class="prettyprint">

    // starting string:
    //     + 1.00000 i* j l* k 

    // normal-ordered strings:
    //     + 1.00000 i* k d(jl) 
    //     - 1.00000 i* l* j k 
</pre>
<br>
This simple example can be verified by hand.  Other more complicated strings are much more
annoying to rearrange.

Coupled-cluster theory and the Fermi vacuum:
</font>
<div id="content" style="background-color:#000000;text-align:justify;height:1px;

</div>
<br>
<br>

In correlated methods like coupled cluster (CC) theory, normal order is not defined relative
to the true vacuum state, but, rather, relative to the "Fermi vacuum," which is the 
Hartree-Fock (HF) state. The HF state can be generated from the true vacuum state as
<br>
<br>
$$|0\rangle = \prod_i^n \hat{a}_i^{\dagger} |\rangle$$
<br>
<br>
Now, given this reference state, rearranging operator strings relative to the true vacuum will become
far too complicated because of the need to deal with all of the creation operators associated with
constructing the HF state. The solution is to define normal order in a different way. 
<br>
<br>
For the vacuum state,
normal order is defined when the annihilation operators are all to the right of the creation operators. In
this way, any expectation value of a string of normal-ordered operators will be zero. 
For the Fermi vacuum, normal order is defined in a different, yet similar way. We would like to arrange our
operators such that any expectation value involving operators is zero, and we are left only with "fully contracted"
terms involving no creation or annihilation operators. According to this rule, the usual creation or annihilation operators
can act as either creators or annihilators on the Fermi vacuum, depending on the space (particle or hole) in 
which they act. So, \(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_i\) and \(\hat{a}_a\),
are treated as annihilation operators (i.e., they annihilate the HF reference), while \(\hat{a}_j\) and \(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_b\) are treated as creation operators. To bring a string of operators to normal order 
relative to the Fermi vacuum, all \(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_i\) and \(\hat{a}_a\)
must lie to the right of all \(\hat{a}_j\) and \(\hat{a}^{\dagger}_b\).

<br> 
<br> 

Now, we consider the coupled cluster with single and double excitations (CCSD) energy
expression, which should be evaluated with normal-order defined relative to the Fermi vacuum:
<br>
$$E_{\rm {CC}} = \langle 0|e^{-T} H e^{T}|0 \rangle$$
Here, T=T1+T2 and H represent the cluster operator and Hamiltonian, respectively, and the
similarity transformation should be carried out using commutators according to the Baker Campbell Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. 
The following code makes use of the built-in operator string types in pdaggerq (i.e., t1, t2, etc.),
as well as commutator and double commutator functions, to evaluate the CCSD energy. Note that the BCH expansion
truncates after only double commutators in this case. For
specific definitions of these operators and functions, see <a href=https://github.com/edeprince3/pdaggerq/>here</a>.

<pre class="prettyprint">

    import pdaggerq

    pq = pdaggerq.pq_helper('fermi')

    pq.set_print_level(0)

    print('')
    print('    < 0 | e(-T) H e(T) | 0> :')
    print('')

    # H = f + v (fock operator plus fluctuation potential)

    # one-electron part: 
    # f
    pq.add_operator_product(1.0,['f'])

    # [f, T1]
    pq.add_commutator(1.0,['f'],['t1'])

    # [f, T2]
    pq.add_commutator(1.0,['f'],['t2'])

    # two-electron part: 

    # v
    pq.add_operator_product(1.0,['v'])

    # [v, T1]
    pq.add_commutator(1.0,['v'],['t1'])

    # [v, T2]
    pq.add_commutator(1.0,['v'],['t2'])

    # [[v, T1], T1]]
    pq.add_double_commutator(0.5, ['v'],['t1'],['t1'])

    pq.simplify()

    pq.print_fully_contracted()

    pq.clear()
</pre>
<br>
<br>
The output of this code will be

<pre class="prettyprint">

    < 0 | e(-T) H e(T) | 0> :


    // fully-contracted strings:
    //     +     1.00000000000000 f(i,i) 
    //     +     1.00000000000000 f(i,a) t1(a,i) 
    //     -     0.50000000000000 &lt;j,i||j,i&gt; 
    //     +     0.25000000000000 &lt;j,i||a,b&gt; t2(a,b,j,i) 
    //     -     0.50000000000000 &lt;j,i||a,b&gt; t1(a,i) t1(b,j)
</pre>
<br>
<br>
Note that pdaggerq also has a built-in "add_st_operator" function that will automatically generate the nested commutators
that arise in the BCH expansion (up to four nested commutators), which greatly simplifies the code given above:
<pre class="prettyprint">

    import pdaggerq

    pq = pdaggerq.pq_helper('fermi')

    pq.set_print_level(0)

    print('')
    print('    < 0 | e(-T) H e(T) | 0> :')
    print('')

    # H = f + v (fock operator plus fluctuation potential)

    pq.add_st_operator(1.0,['f'],['t1','t2'])
    pq.add_st_operator(1.0,['v'],['t1','t2'])

    pq.simplify()
    pq.print_fully_contracted()
    pq.clear()
</pre>
<br>
<br>
and this code should produce the same output as above.
<br>
<br>



Now, your task is to evaluate the CCSD singles and doubles equations according to 
<br>
$$\langle 0 | \hat{a}_m^{\dagger}\hat{a}_e e^{-T} H e^{T}|0 \rangle$$
and
<br>
$$\langle 0 | \hat{a}_m^{\dagger}\hat{a}_n^{\dagger} \hat{a}_f \hat{a}_e e^{-T} H e^{T}|0\rangle $$
<br>
<br>
You should initialize pdaggerq relative to the Fermi vacuum and use the 
built-in "set_left_operators" function to indicate that your bra state is \(\langle 0 | \hat{a}_m^{\dagger}\hat{a}_e \)
or \(\langle 0 | \hat{a}_m^{\dagger}\hat{a}_n^{\dagger} \hat{a}_f \hat{a}_e\). For example, for 
the singles equations, you would begin with
<pre class="prettyprint">

    import pdaggerq

    pq = pdaggerq.pq_helper('fermi')

    pq.set_left_operators([['e1(m,e)']])
</pre>
